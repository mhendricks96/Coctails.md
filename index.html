            <img>
            <p>this is where i will wax poetically about the virtues of the Gimlet. The most basic and simple cocktail is also the most refreshing and satisfying to drink.</p>

            <h2>Old Fashioned</h2>
            <img>
            <p>This is where I will extole the virtues of the worlds first cocktail. The old fashioned was a cocktail before there was a name for it and will always be the backbone of American cocktails.</p>

            <h2>The Martini</h2>
            <img>
            <p>The preferred Drink of James Bond and everyones aunt. I have no idea why, as I believe it is the worst cocktail invented. I am not the gatekeeper of cocktails, though and it has earned its spot on the list</p>
